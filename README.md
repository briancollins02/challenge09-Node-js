  ## Description
  This repository holds the code for a simple readme generator. This code was written as an assignment for class, but allowed my to further my understanding of how node works and specifically using inquirer and fs to prompt a user and create or edit a file. A specific challenge I had was connecting the index.js file to the generateMarkdown.js file. But once accomplished, the entire method and process was easily understood.

  ## Installation
  Once the code is on your local machine, type the command npm install within the root folder. This will install the required software, inquirer and fs to run the program. If you don't already have nodejs installed, that will be required first.

  ## Usage
  once the project is installed, run "node index.js" in the root folder from your terminal and respond to the prompts. The readme file will be created in the root folder under the name of the project that you gave it.
